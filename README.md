# ![icon](https://github.com/mstuyts/QuickCRS/blob/master/QuickCRS/icon.png?raw=true) "QuickCRS" for [QGIS](http://qgis.org)
*A QGIS plugin to set the CRS of the current project to your favourite CRS and enable OTF reprojection with just one click.*

It's very easy to set your default CRS this plugin uses in the Plugin Settings Menu.

**You can install this plugin, but be aware that it is experimental. It may still have some bugs.  Please [report them](https://github.com/mstuyts/QuickCRS/issues).**

_____

*If you installed QuickCRS version 0.2 or older, you should install only version 0.3.2 or newer.*

_____

*An issue was [reported](https://github.com/mstuyts/QuickCRS/issues/1) about installation in QGIS for Mac . If you try to install this plugin on a Mac, please report information about it to the [issue page](https://github.com/mstuyts/QuickCRS/issues/1). Since I don't own a Mac it's hard to resolve the issue. With installation on Windows and Linux, the problem doesn't occur.*
