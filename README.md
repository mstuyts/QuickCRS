# QuickCRS

A QGIS plugin to set the CRS of the current project to your favourite CRS and enable OTF reprojection with just one click. It's very easy to set your default CRS in the Plugin Settings Menu.

**You can install this plugin, but be aware that it isn't finished yet. It still has some bugs.  Please [report them](https://github.com/mstuyts/QuickCRS/issues).**
